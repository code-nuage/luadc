## What is luadc?
`luadc` is a âœ¨ wonderful âœ¨ Lua library that allows you to create retro styled dungeon in the terminal.

- luadc allows you to draw interactive things to the screen, using the magic of `curses`
- It can manages collisions between these interactive things
- It also manages text and user interfaces

`luadc` is a good choice if you want:
- Easy to use terminal library
- Retro-stylish (although revamped) dungeon crawler games
- Simple collisions detection

`luadc` is a bad choice if you want:
- 2D detailed graphics (use LÃ–VE https://love2d.org/)
- Detailed rectangle collisions (use bump.lua https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua)
- A way to create interactives **menus** (just use `curses` by default)

## How to install luadc?

First of all install `lua-rocks` via your operating system (https://luarocks.org/#quick-start)

```
